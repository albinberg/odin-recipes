# odin-recipes
A basic recipe website using HTML | First assignment of the Odin Project

## Description
This will be my first project on the Odin Project and so it's also my first "real" website using HTML. It will demonstrate my having some basic knowledge about HTML syntax, tags and elements as well as how to build the file structure. It will also showcase my basic understanding of git and making proper commits.

the website will consist of a homepage with short descriptions and titles of recipes. From there you will be linked to a separate pae for each recipe.
